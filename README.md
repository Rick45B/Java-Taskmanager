# Java-Taskmanager
## Description
A small taskmanager developed entirely in java as a college assignment.
It uses swing for all the GUI's, and Junit for all its tests. It contains basic exceptions, whose classes reside inside the package **src/exceptions**.<br>
Most of the javadocs and the GUI's are in italian.
## Usage
If the user wishes to run the application with the swing GUI's, then the program must be started by running the compiled class StartGUI.java. Otherwise, if the user wishes to use the terminal GUI, then the program must be started by running the compiled class 
TerminalGUI.java, which both reside inside the package **src/gui**.<br>
After that, just follow the instructions on screen. Inside the package **src/test** can be found all the Junit tests of the project, and can be freely run.
